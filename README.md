## Software Stack

**HoloLens Application**
The HoloLens Experiences team will be implementing the HoloLens application. It will locate the robot by name. When activated, the HoloLens application will command the robot.

**Robot Application**
The Robot is built using the Universal Windows Application Platform in C#. It is a headless background task configured to launch shortly after boot.

**HTTP Command Handler**
At application start, a socket is created at port 3000 which accepts connections. On connection, http headers are manually processed and query parameters broken up and interpreted. The commands are then dispatched to the Robot object

**Robot Object**
The Robot object takes raw commands and interprets them in the context of the robot - with understanding of it's physical geometry.

**Arduino Object**
The Arduino object will manage the connection and send commands using Firmata.

## Command structure
Commands are HTTP web requests of the form:
- `bot?cmd=<COMMAND>;<COMMAND_PARAM>;<COMMAND_PARAM>`
 
Responses will be of the form:
- JSON data structure
 
## Command list
- `stop`
  * Description: All stop (full motion reset)
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `status`
  * Description: Reports current command and percent of way through
  * Response: {command="<ACTIVE_COMMAND>", percent="<0-100>"}
- `move`
  * Description: Translate forward specified distance (negative values are backwards)
  * Required params:  dst - distance (in cm)
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `moveLR`
  * Description: Translate forward specified distance, per wheel (negative values are backwards)
  * Required params:  dstL - distance (in cm) for left wheel, dstR - distance (in cm) for right wheel
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `rotate`
  * Description: Rotate right specified degrees (negative values are supported for left turns)
  * Required Params: deg - degrees
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `armExtend`
  * Description: Extend arm
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `armRetract`
  * Description: Extend arm
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>"}
- `getBattery`
  * Description: Reports battery level
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>", percent="<0-100>"}
- `getWiFi`
  * Description: Reports wifi signal strength
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>", percent="<0-100>"}
- `getCompass`
  * Description: Reports rotational direction from north (in degrees)
  * Response: {success="<ok, ERROR_CODE>", angle="<0-360>"}
 
## Error codes
- `error - General error` -- (no specific information to give)
- `error_invalid_request` -- Invalid request
- `error_system_state` -- System/bot is in a bad state, cannot complete request right now
 
## Examples
- `bot?cmd=move;dst=100` -- Bot to go forwards 100 cm
- `bot?cmd=rotate;deg=90` -- Bot rotate right 90 (degrees in place)


## Trivia
* We built 5 robots for the //build demo. Originally we were going to have two, which we named Hansel and Gretel. To mitigate risk, we decided to make a total of 5 robots - we named the rest following the theme - Crumb, Ginger and Candy. [Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PaAWvygQk) was built in Timelapse.
* We started the project about 4 weeks before the demo.
* IoT Core on Raspberry Pi GPIO was not functioning at the time we started the demo, so we used an Arduino for the motors
* We originally were going to have the robot do a 'selfie', with an extending boom built using an Automotive antenna.
* The neck was articulated with a motor - but we didn't use it in the demo because it was slow for the animation.
* The caster caused us lots of grief - it would 'kick' when turning throwing off the tracking.
* We rebuilt the lighting system just a few days before the demo because the overhead lights washed out our original system. However, we didn't want the lights to brown out the CPU, which is why it is on an independent circuit.
* The mechanics were designed by [Bert](https://github.com/JustAddWires). He also machined the wheels, axle and caster mount.
